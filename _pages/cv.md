Since October 2022, I am a doctoral student in theoretical computer science at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/) under the supervision of [Susanna F. de Rezende](https://derezende.github.io/index.html) and [Jakob Nordström](https://jakobnordstrom.github.io/), as part of the Mathematical Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO) research group. I am funded by the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software](https://wasp-sweden.org/) (WASP) program.

Before that, I completed the [Master of Logic](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/) at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) (ILLC) of the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), where I graduated _cum laude_ with a [thesis](https://eprints.illc.uva.nl/id/eprint/2210/1/MoL-2022-11.text.pdf) on the relation between parameterized complexity and knowledge compilation, supervised by [Ronald de Haan](https://staff.science.uva.nl/r.dehaan/) and Hubie Chen. I was partially funded by the E. W. Beth Foundation.

During 2021, I worked as a pre-doctoral researcher at the [Logic and Reasoning](https://www.ehu.eus/es/web/lorea) (LoRea) research group of the [University of the Basque Country](https://www.ehu.eus/en/en-home) under the supervision of Montserrat Hermo, studying the computational complexity of realizability and synthesis of temporal specifications. In 2020 I earned my BSc in Computer Science from the University of the Basque Country in San Sebastián, Spain, where I was born. During the academic year 2019-20, I was at the [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/) in Belgium, where I studied under the supervision of Marc Denecker and Matthias van der Hallen and wrote my BSc thesis on topics related to the empirical proof complexity of quantified Boolean formulas. 

I am broadly interested in computational complexity theory and its interplay with logic. I am also intermittently interested in the philosophy of mathematics and mathematical practice. On the latter topic, I founded and co-organised the [Φ-Math reading group](https://sites.google.com/view/phi-math/) in philosophy of mathematics at the ILLC.

I am also interested in game studies and narrative, particularly in video games, about which I have written in different Spanish publications.
