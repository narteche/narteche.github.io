I recently graduated _cum laude_ from the Master of Logic at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](http://www.illc.uva.nl) (ILLC) at the University of Amsterdam. I am currently also collaborating as a researcher at the [Logic and Reasoning](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ehu.eus%2Fes%2Fweb%2Florea&sa=D) (LoRea) research group at the Faculty of Computer Science of the University of the Basque Country.

Before that, I graduated first of my year in Computer Science at the University of the Basque Country with an exchange year at the KU Leuven in Belgium, where I wrote my Bachelor's thesis on topics related to the proof complexity of quantified Boolean formulas.

I am interested in **computational complexity theory** and **philosophy of mathematics**, particularly in non-traditional intersections between these and other fields.

I founded and co-organised the [Î¦-Math reading group](https://sites.google.com/view/phi-math/) in philosophy of mathematics at the ILLC.

Besides, I am interested in game studies and narrative, particularly in video games, about which I have written in different Spanish publications.
