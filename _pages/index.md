I am a PhD student in theoretical computer science at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/) and [University of Copenhagen](https://di.ku.dk/english/research/ac/) under the supervision of [Susanna F. de Rezende](https://derezende.github.io/index.html) and [Jakob Nordström](https://jakobnordstrom.github.io/).

Between January and May 2023 I was a visiting graduate student at the [Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage) at UC Berkeley for the [Meta-Complexity program](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/Meta-Complexity2023). Previously, I graduated from the [Master of Logic](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/) at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) (ILLC) of the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).

I am broadly interested in computational complexity theory, proof complexity and their interplay with logic. I am also intermittently interested in the philosophy of mathematics and mathematical practice. You can read more about me [here](https://narteche.github.io/about).
