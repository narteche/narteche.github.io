I recently graduated cum laude from the Master of Logic at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) at the University of Amsterdam. I am currently also working as a researcher at the Logic and Reasoning (LoRea) research group at the Faculty of Computer Science of the University of the Basque Country.

Currently, I'm a NOT PhD candidate at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](http://www.illc.uva.nl) (ILLC) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/) (Research Unit: Mathematical & Computational Logic). My supervisors are [Professor Benedikt LÃ¶we](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/) and [Professor Rosalie Iemhoff](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/RIemhoff). My research is funded by a [doctoral scholarship](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en/promotion/) of the [Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de).
