I am a PhD student in theoretical computer science at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/) under the supervision of [Susanna F. de Rezende](https://derezende.github.io/index.html) and [Jakob Nordstr√∂m](https://jakobnordstrom.github.io/).

Previosly, I completed the [Master of Logic](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/) at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) (ILLC) of the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), where I graduated _cum laude_ with a [thesis](https://eprints.illc.uva.nl/id/eprint/2210/1/MoL-2022-11.text.pdf) on the relation between parameterized complexity and knowledge compilation, supervised by [Ronald de Haan](https://staff.science.uva.nl/r.dehaan/) and Hubie Chen.

I am broadly interested in computational complexity theory and its interplay with logic. I am also intermittently interested in the philosophy of mathematics and mathematical practice. You can read more about me [here](https://narteche.github.io/about).
